# Portfolio (TypeScript)

This project is a **TypeScript redesign and port** of my previous portfolio: [old portfolio](https://github.com/nmarcusg/portfolio).

- The original portfolio was built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Express for SPA routing).
- This version is fully typed with TypeScript.
- Built with Vite + React.
- Features an updated design and improved layout compared to the original.
